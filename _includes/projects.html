                    <span class="project-title"><a href="http://jeronimomora.com/docs/JeronimoMoraMasters.pdf" target="_blank">Investigation into Energy Efficiency of Vector Field Based CNC Toolpaths</a></span> - <span class="project-tagline">Compiled, modified, and integrated C++ software for the generation of vector-field based toolpaths for CNC machining. Improved process efficiency of previous approach by over 6.5%. Discovered systematic errors in previously published work and implemented improvements to experiments in order to make data collection more meaningful.  </span>

Code generates g-code for a 3D printer such that it can solve the puzzles with an attached writing instrument. Designed a suitable writing instrument attachment for my 3D printer's toolhead.</span>
